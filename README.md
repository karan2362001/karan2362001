🚀 Karan Patani: The Code Wizard of Ahmedabad! 🧙‍♂️

👋 Greetings, mortal! I’m Karan Patani, a Python-slinging, AI-wielding developer from Ahmedabad, India. By day, I brew backend magic at Vrinsoft Technology Pvt Ltd. By night, I’m either automating the world, building e-commerce empires, or chatting with PLCs (yes, those industrial robots 🤖). Buckle up for a wild ride through my GitHub galaxy!

🎭 The Epic Tale of Karan, the Code Alchemist
Once upon a time in Ahmedabad, a young coder named Karan discovered a mystical artifact: Python. With a flick of his keyboard, he tamed Django dragons, summoned AI agents, and even made PLCs dance to his tunes. From automating accounts at Vrinsoft to crafting kite-selling e-commerce platforms for Uttarayan, Karan’s adventures are legendary. His mission? To conquer bugs, deploy awesomeness, and maybe sneak in a dance break or two 💃.
